## ‚úÖ ANSWERED QUESTIONS & DECISIONS

### PPPP Course Automation ‚úÖ
1. **Content Release**: Fully automated Saturday 7AM ET with admin pause switch for extra weeks
2. **Current Cohorts**: Keep existing cohorts, create sections for them in new system
3. **Video Hosting**: Keep YouTube for now (90-120min/week = cost effective), flag AWS migration for future

### Cellosophy Business Model ‚úÖ
4. **Teacher Payments**: $5/student + $5/certification (simple model, max $10/student)
5. **Student Progress**: Self-paced, teachers optional observers (no approval needed)
6. **Pricing Tiers**: 
   - With Teacher: $39/mo or $399/yr (teacher gets unique code/link)
   - Self-Study: $99/mo or $999/yr

### Technical Decisions ‚úÖ
7. **Authentication**: Need recommendation (see below)
8. **Teacher Verification**: Manual approval within 24 hours ‚Üí auto-generate dashboard + unique code
9. **Priority**: PPPP automation first

## üö® REMAINING CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

## ‚úÖ ANSWERED QUESTIONS ROUND 2

### Authentication & Tech Stack ‚úÖ
10. **Auth Choice**: Stick with Clerk (free tier, better Google SSO) - you have both installed already

### Sheet Music Store UX ‚úÖ  
11. **Discovery**: Need better UX than "shirt shop" layout - maybe sheet music store IRL experience
12. **Digital Delivery**: Download with auto-checked email subscription at checkout

### Video Hosting ‚úÖ
13. **Migration**: AWS when needed (YouTube is free so no rush to change)

### Conversion Strategy ‚úÖ
14. **Video Content**: Have unedited PPPP video, can do personal story, maybe free Popper unit
15. **A/B Testing**: Skip for now (not enough traffic)
16. **Email Sequences**: Created EmailMarketing.md for future development

### Business Priorities ‚úÖ
17. **Revenue Focus**: PPPP (one signup = entire year of sheet music revenue!)
18. **Launch Timeline**: ASAP once MVP ready

### PPPP Structure Details ‚úÖ
- **Pedagogical Order**: Not numerical (Week 1: Etude 11, Week 2: Etude 11+16, etc.)
- **Homepage Updates**: Weekly text updates + links to current week's etudes
- **Archive System**: Previous weeks move to "etudes studied" list
- **Video Template**: Simple YT embed template with 6-7 videos per page
